If on a student visa, you must maintain satisfactory progress in your course (visa condition 8202) so you can complete it before the end of your CoE. To do this, you would normally enrol in a standard study load of at least 50 credit points in each main study period (or 100 - 150 credit points across a calendar year).  To help you meet this requirement, the University monitors your progress and, in some circumstances, can approve a reduced study load. How to apply: 1. Contact an International Student Adviser to discuss your situation, the range of support services available, and alternative options, such as a ‘Leave of Absence’.   2. Email U.Connect@utas.edu.au to request a reduced load. Your email needs to be received before the census date, and must include:  The number of units you wish to enrol in for the study period  A personal statement detailing the compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting your study Any relevant supporting documents, in English  You do not need to request approval for a reduced study load if:  The number of units you can enrol in has been restricted by the University You are in your final study period (and need fewer than 50 credit points to complete your course) You're on track to complete your degree by the end of your CoE but credit you've received leaves you with fewer than 50 credit points available to enrol in a study period.  What are compassionate or compelling circumstances?  These are situations, usually unexpected, which are beyond your control and significantly affect your progress in your course or your wellbeing. Potential impact of a reduced study load:  Taking a reduced study load will affect your study plan and, depending on your course it may affect when you can take units. For study plan advice, contact a Student Adviser through UConnect – email U.Connect@utas.edu.au or call 13 8827 (13 UTAS) / +61 3 6226 6200. You may take longer to complete your degree and need to apply for an extension to your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). This may also mean applying for a further student visa.

For more information, see Fees and Charges - International All students: Your fees may be different from other students for reasons such as residency or citizenship, scholarships, student exchange programs, and the course or units that you are enrolled in. The annual unit and course fees can also vary from year to year so, if you accepted your offer at different times, your fees may be different.

Scholarships which include a work experience component are generally tax exempt provided the work experience is not compulsory (i.e. the offer letter states 'you may be invited to undertake work experience with (company name) over the summer vacation period'. Scholarships, bursaries or awards held by students who are enrolled part-time are generally not tax exempt and may need to be declared as taxable income.  The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provides online interactive scholarship decision tools that can help you identify whether or not your scholarship should be taxed.  Please visit the ATO website.  To check whether your scholarship will affect your Centrelink payments:  For confirmation about your specific situation, you should contact Centrelink and the Scholarships Office (for merit-based scholarships) directly.

        "content": "Updated \t08/09/2023 11.33 AM   Domestic students: If you are in an undergraduate course, it is likely to be a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP).  This is where the Government pays for a portion of your tution fees and you pay the remainder - the 'student contribution'. See your letter of offer to check if you are in a Commonwealth Supported Place or not. The Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) is charged separately from the tuition fees.  If you have not been offered a CSP course, you will pay the full tuition fees (which have SSAF built in) for each unit.   For more information, see Fees and Charges - domestic  International students: You are not eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place and will need to organise to pay your tuition fees in full.  Your tuition fees have the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) built in so you do not need to pay for this separately. If eligible, you may receive the Tasmanian International Scholarship to receive discounted tuition.  For more information, see Fees and Charges - International All students: Your fees may be different from other students for reasons such as residency or citizenship, scholarships, student exchange programs, and the course or units that you are enrolled in. The annual unit and course fees can also vary from year to year so, if you accepted your offer at different times, your fees may be different. When applying and enrolling at the University it is critical to understand your finance options and either apply to defer your fees (where eligible) or organise to pay your fees by the due date.  Login in to eStudent to view and pay your fees and submit requests for Commonwealth Assistance.",

        "title": "How are rents set for University accommodation?",
        "content": "Updated \t29/04/2024 01.00 AM   Our rents are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of how costs have changed in Australia over time. Usually, the CPI goes up, reflecting inflation and the rising costs of good and services. Additionally, we carry out a review of rents every five years. These annual and five yearly processes ensure we can continue to provide high quality student accommodation.   Unlike a private rental, our rents include a range of things such as electricity and water, unlimited high-speed internet, furniture, and communal areas. We also offer a range of wrap-around support services and a program of activities throughout our college communities.   We cap all our campus accommodation properties at or below 75 percent of market rate, which we check each year using an independent valuer. We also offer rental discounts through our scholarship and bursary programs, specifically the Support to Study program for commencing students and the Accommodation Equity Bursary for continuing students.   Find out more about our University accommodation.",
